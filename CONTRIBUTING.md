## Code of Conduct

Dalec has adopted the CNCF Code of Conduct. Refer to our [Community Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for details.  For more information see the Code of Conduct FAQ or contact opencode@microsoft.com with any additional questions or comments.

## Contributing a patch

1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change to the repository in question. The repository owners will respond to your issue promptly.
2. Fork the desired repository, then develop and test your code changes.
3. Submit a pull request.

When you submit a pull request all commits must include a [DCO signed-off](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/dco).
The CNCF-operated `dco-2` GitHub App enforces this policy on every branch, blocking merges until the status check passes.

## Issue and pull request management

Anyone can comment on issues and submit reviews for pull requests. In order to be assigned an issue or pull request, you can leave a `/assign <your Github ID>` comment on the issue or pull request.
